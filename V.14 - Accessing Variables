!THIS SCRIPT TEACHES US HOW TO:
!1. DEFINE OBJECTS AND SETS OF OBJECTS
!2. RETURN A SPECIFIC SET OF OBJECTS(IN THIS EX, LOADS)
!3. ACCESS A CERTAIN VARIABLE FROM AN OBJECT
!4. MODIFY A CERTAIN VARIABLE OR CHARACTERISTIC OF AN OBJECT


ClearOutput(); !Clear the output
EchoOff();

LOADs = AllRelevant('*.ElmLod'); !Returns a set with calculation relevant object

!Get a variable from object

for (LOAD = LOADs.First(); LOAD; LOAD = LOADs.Next()) {

    var = LOAD:plini;
    printf('%s %d %s','LOAD active power is: ', var,'[MW]');

}

!END Get a variable from object

!Modify a variable from element - Make random out service lines  
for (LOAD = LOADs.First(); LOAD; LOAD = LOADs.Next()){
    
    a = Random();
    if (a < 0.5){
      
        LOAD:outserv = 1; !Make a load outservice
    
    } 
    
    else {
        
        LOAD:outserv = 0; !Make a load inservice
    }
} 
!END Modify a variable from element - Make random out service lines 

!YOU CAN GET THE VARIABLE NAMES FROM HOLD THE MOUSE ON PARTICULAR DATA
!LIKE HOLD THE MOUSE ON ACTIVE POWER (plini), REACTIVE POWER (qlini)
