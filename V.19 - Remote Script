!Use a generic remote script to randomly take out of service some loads
!in the network and to run Load Flow a certain # of times (1000)
!if Load Flow is divergent, exit subscript

!The main script will send to the remote script an input
!variable (# of iterations) and the remote script will send
!back an output variable (current iteration) 



double Input, Output, i;

!THIS SCRIPT TEACHES US HOW TO:
!1. CONFIGURE AND USE GENERIC REMOTE SCRIPTS
!2. EXECUTE REMOTE SCRIPTS
!3. EXIT A SCRIPT USIND DPL COMMAND

Input = 1000; !# of iterations

LoadFlowSubscript.Execute(Input,Output); !Execute loadflow

i = Output;

printf('%s %d', 'Load Flow become divergent at iteration', i);
